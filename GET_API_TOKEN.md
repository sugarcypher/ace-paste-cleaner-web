# Getting the Correct Gumroad API Token

The token you provided (`M5n2xDP-vvrOVRt3cxMqu0wwhBQNSAlinzm9OCOGInQ`) appears to be an OAuth application token, but we need a **Personal API Token** for creating products.

## 🔐 How to Get the Correct API Token

### Method 1: Personal API Token (Recommended)
1. Go to https://gumroad.com/settings/advanced
2. Look for "API Access" or "Personal API Token"
3. Generate a new **Personal API Token** (not OAuth token)
4. Copy the token

### Method 2: Check OAuth Application Settings
1. Go to https://gumroad.com/oauth/applications
2. Find your "agent" application
3. Check if there's a different token type needed
4. Look for "API Key" or "Secret Key" fields

### Method 3: Check Developer Settings
1. Go to https://gumroad.com/settings/developer
2. Look for API credentials
3. Generate new API keys if needed

## 🧪 Test the Token

Once you have the correct token, run this command to test it:

```bash
cd /Users/br14r/Documents/GitHub/ace-paste-cleaner-web
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/ruby/3.4.6/bin/ruby find_correct_api_token.rb
```

## 🎯 What We Need

We need a token that returns **200 OK** when accessing:
- `https://api.gumroad.com/v2/user`
- `https://api.gumroad.com/v2/products`

The current token returns **401 Unauthorized** for all API endpoints.

## 🚀 Once We Have the Right Token

I'll be able to:
1. ✅ Create all 9 products automatically
2. ✅ Set up proper pricing and descriptions
3. ✅ Configure the correct URLs
4. ✅ Test the entire purchase flow
5. ✅ Handle future product creation for your other projects

**The app is ready - we just need the correct API token!**
