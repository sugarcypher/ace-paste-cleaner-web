## Recent Security Fixes

### CWE-570/571: Expression Always Evaluates to True/False
**Status**: âœ… FIXED (September 27, 2025)

**Issue Description**: 
Static analysis detected expressions that always evaluate to the same boolean value, which could indicate logical errors or dead code paths that might mask security issues.

**Locations Fixed**:
- `src/App.tsx:810` - Gumroad URL validation logic
- `src/App.tsx:827` - Upsell URL validation logic

**Fix Implementation**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Always True Expression):
if (gumroadUrl) { // Always true for predefined object keys
  window.open(gumroadUrl, '_blank');
}

// AFTER (Proper Validation):
if (gumroadUrl && typeof gumroadUrl === 'string') {
  window.open(gumroadUrl, '_blank');
} else {
  console.error('Invalid URL for tier:', tierId);
}
```

### Additional Security Enhancements (September 27, 2025)

1. **Input Type Validation**: Added runtime type checking for all user inputs
2. **Clipboard Security**: Implemented size limits (10MB) and type validation for clipboard operations
